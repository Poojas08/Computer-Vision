The program does the following:
• load a monochrome image (uncompressed);
• construct a 5-level Gaussian pyramid, putting the subimages into a larger image for display;
• construct a 5-level Laplacian pyramid, putting the subimages into a larger image for display;
• compute the Fourier transforms (magnitudes) of each of the twelve images generated, and display them.
