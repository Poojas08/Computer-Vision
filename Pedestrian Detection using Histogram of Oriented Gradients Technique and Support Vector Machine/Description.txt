Support Vector Machine is used for training the data. There are different kernels to
choose from for SVM depending upon the data. Since the data for Pedestrian Detection was not
linearly separable , instead of Linear SVM, Radial Basis Function kernel was used. RBF Kernel 
makes linearly- non separable data linearly separable by making them into high dimension
feature space.
The gamma value used in the function above can be changed accordingly.
I have trained models on three different Gamma Values for RBF. One them is default ‘SCALE’
value that uses 1 / (n_features * X.var()) as value of gamma. So it is different with respect to
window size.
For HoG Descriptor , model is separately trained for window size 8x8 , 6x6 and 4x4 with pixel
cell size 2x2 for each value of gamma considered.
After generating feature vector from HOG model, we train the model using SVM, which will
generate a file. For test images, again feature vector will be generated by HOG and then we’ll
use that file to detect pedestrian in test images.
The images are classified as “1” if pedestrian is detected, otherwise “0
