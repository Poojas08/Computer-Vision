Python3.7 is used as main programming language to implement
this project. Modules which were imported are Numpy , OpenCV, Scikit-Learn.
2416 positive Images were used and 4146 negative images were used for training.
60 Positive Images and 187 negative images were used for testing
Feature vector for 8x8 is of size 3780
Feature vector for 4x4 is of size 16740
Feature vector for 6x6 is of size 6562
PRE-PROCESSING : All of the images are cropped to the same size 64x128 so as to have
feature vector of uniform size. Also, images are converted to grayscale.
